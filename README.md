# Habit Tracker

## What is Habit Tracker?
Born out of my frustration to maintain accurate time sheets and from my obsession with tracking all aspects of my life, this simple web app allows a user to:
1. **Track** their work sessions via a stopwatch or timer.
2. **Label** each session with customisable metadata.
3. **Review & manage** recorded sessions from the past
4. **Analyse** their trends over time to help with designing an optimal personalised work schedule. [coming soon]

The long-term vision is to build integrations with health & fitness trackers and correllate them with the measured data, which will allow for even more accurate personalised suggestions.

## Features in action
### Track using stopwatch or timer
To measure the time of your work sessions, you can choose between a stopwatch (clock increments indefinitely) or a timer (clock decrements until it reaches 0):

### Add a title and label
Each session can have a title and label assigned. This will help you stay more organised and enables better filtering & analysis:

### Manage past sessions & metadata
Sessions can be reviewed and modified. Here you can also modify the labels - their name and color:

### [coming soon] Analyse trends
(this feature is currently under development) Gain valuable insights about your habits & trends by analysing your past sessions.

## Contributing
The repository is public mainly because it is part of my freelancing portfolio at zoltanhanesz.com so I do not expect contributions from the public nor can I support maintaining this as an open-source project with frequent updates, code reviews etc.

That being said, if you have somehow stumbled upon it and would like to make a contribution, feel free to raise a Github issue or pull request...I'll do my best to review as soon as I find time :blush:
