# This is Habit Tracker

Born out of my frustration to maintain accurate time sheets and from my obsession with tracking all aspects of my life, this simple web app allows a user to:
1. **Track** their work sessions via a stopwatch or timer.
2. **Label** each session with customisable metadata.
3. **Review & manage** recorded sessions from the past
4. **Analyse** their trends over time to help with designing an optimal personalised work schedule. [coming soon]

The long-term vision is to build integrations with health & fitness trackers and correllate them with the measured data, which will allow for even more accurate personalised suggestions.
